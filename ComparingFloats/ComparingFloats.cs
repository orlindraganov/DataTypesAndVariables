 * Write a program that safely compares two floating-point numbers (double) with precision eps = 0.000001.
 * 
 * Note: Two floating-point numbers a and b cannot be compared directly by a == b because of the nature of the floating-point arithmetic. 
 * Therefore, we assume two numbers are equal if they are more closely to each other than a fixed constant eps.
